# notes2

This is the second version of the notes app.

I added a box where users can view their notes.

Previous version already had these functionalities:

Each note has a title and a textbox.

It gets what user inputs, user needs to input the title and the text for each note.

It saves all the notes in the localStorage.

Every time a new note is created, it saves the new note in the localStorage and refreshes the drop down menu
that has all the titles of previous created notes.

When user delete a note, it deletes the note from localStorage and refreshes the drop down menu to reflect that change.

User can also edit a note. To do so, user needs to select the note from the drop down menu and after editing it,
the note can be saved by clicking on save button.
